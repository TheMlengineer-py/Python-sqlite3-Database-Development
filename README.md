# Python-sqlite3-Database-Development
SQLite3 is a self-contained, file-based SQL database. SQLite comes bundled with Python and can be used in any of your Python applications without having to install any additional software.

I created a connection to a SQLite database, added two tables to the database, insert data into that tables, and read, dispaly and loaded the database into a csv file using Pandas
